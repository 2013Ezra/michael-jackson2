        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and<br>
            philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures<br>
            of the
            20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his
            publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across
            many
            music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the
            moonwalk,
            to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded musician in history.
